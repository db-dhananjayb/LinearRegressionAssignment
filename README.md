## General Information
- Objective : build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
- Background/DataSet and Goals : A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. Bike sharing systems were recent concept in vehicle sharing segment and since pandemic bike-sharing systems business is affected. 
A comprehensive dataset is available based on which we need to understand
a. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
b. How well those variables describe the bike demands
Business Goal:
It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Accordingly service provider can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for service provider to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


## Conclusions
- The demand on a given day be determined by a multiple linear regression model consisting of earlier day registered users and calender months.
